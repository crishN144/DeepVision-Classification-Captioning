## Dataset

### Description

This project uses a subset of the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset for image captioning and a subset of TinyImageNet for classification tasks. Key details about the datasets include:

- **Full COCO Dataset:** Contains 330K images across 80 object categories. [Learn more about COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home)
- **Our Subset (COCO_5070):** Consists of approximately 5070 images, each with five or more different descriptive captions.
- **TinyImageNet Subset:** Used for image classification with:
  - 30 different categories
  - 450 resized images (64x64 pixels) per category in the training set

## Visualizations

### 1. COCO Dataset Training - Vocabulary Size and Epochs Impact

![COCO Dataset Training](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c3ea052-1cd8-4625-b0c0-db64d3f4d1a9)

#### Description:
This graph illustrates the training and validation loss over epochs for the COCO dataset with a vocabulary size of 2537 words. The red line represents the training loss, while the green line shows the validation loss.

**Key Observations:**
- The training loss (red) decreases steadily over the epochs, indicating good learning progress.
- The validation loss (green) initially decreases but then plateaus, suggesting potential overfitting after the 2nd epoch.
- The gap between training and validation loss widens as epochs progress, further indicating overfitting.

### 2. Learning Rate Comparison - Loss and Accuracy Curves

![Learning Rate Comparison Accuracy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8397668-8ff7-4f56-9605-a5f4403b6a44)

#### Description:
These graphs compare the performance of the model with different learning rates (0.1, 0.01, 0.001) over 30 epochs.

**Key Observations:**
- **Loss Curves:**
  - Learning rate 0.1 (blue) shows unstable behavior with high loss.
  - Learning rate 0.01 (green) demonstrates the best performance with the lowest loss.
  - Learning rate 0.001 (purple) shows steady but slower improvement.

- **Accuracy Curves:**
  - Learning rate 0.01 (green) achieves the highest training accuracy.
  - Validation accuracies for 0.01 and 0.001 are comparable, with 0.01 slightly higher.
  - Learning rate 0.1 shows poor accuracy, indicating it's too high for effective learning.

### 3. Model Performance with Dropout

#### Description:
These graphs show the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs for a model implemented with dropout.

**Key Observations:**
- **Loss Curves:**
  - Training loss (blue) consistently decreases over epochs.
  - Validation loss (orange) decreases initially but shows fluctuations, indicating some overfitting.

- **Accuracy Curves:**
  - Training accuracy (blue) increases steadily, reaching about 65% by the final epoch.
  - Validation accuracy (orange) improves but plateaus around 50%, suggesting the model generalizes reasonably well but has room for improvement.

### 4. Image Captioning Example

![Image Captioning Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5225d1f5-03fa-4e7a-85c0-ffa79d8ab96e)

#### Description:
This image demonstrates the model's image captioning capability.

**Generated Caption:** "a man riding a horse in a field"

**Key Observations:**
- The model correctly identifies the main elements of the image: a person, a horse, and the outdoor setting.
- While the generated caption is concise and accurate, it misses some details like the path or the mountain in the background.
- The lack of reference captions prevents a direct comparison, but the generated caption appears to capture the essence of the image well.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in image classification and captioning tasks. Key conclusions include:

1. CNNs significantly outperform MLPs for image classification tasks.
2. Data augmentation and dropout are crucial for improving model generalization.
3. Transfer learning can dramatically improve performance, especially on smaller datasets.
4. RNN-based models show promise in generating coherent image captions.

These findings provide valuable insights into the application of deep learning in computer vision tasks and offer a foundation for further research and development in this field.
